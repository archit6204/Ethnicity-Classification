# Ethnicity-Classification
This Deep Learning model differentiates among Chinese, Korean and Japanese. We Implemented the machine learning approach to classify and predict whether it is Chinese, Korean or Japanese based on the facial images.
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean have similar facial features partially due to their geographical similarities. Some people claim that they can differentiate these three subgroups of East Asian based on how they look. But it is very hard to eyeball the difference.  I took the challenge to investigate whether or not it is possible to classify East Asians whose faces are highly resembling and whether or not there might be a mathematical rationale behind these nuances that are not so obvious to human eyes. By using Machine learning methods and provide easiness to differentiate among East Asians.
